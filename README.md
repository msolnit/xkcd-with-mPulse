## Introduction

This project is meant to be a fun way of demonstrating the capabilities of SOASTA mPulse for iOS apps. It's a fork of the excellent [open-source app](https://github.com/paulrehkugler/xkcd) by Paul Rehkugler, and is **not** meant as a replacement of that version. This is for demo purposes only.

I repeat: if you're looking for a quality xkcd app, go to the [original](https://github.com/paulrehkugler/xkcd). If you want to learn about mPulse for iOS, however, then you've come to the right place!

## Tell me more!
