To insert your own mPulse API key, edit the `AppDelegate.swift` file, line 19:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nMPulse.initializeWithAPIKey(\"INSERT API KEY HERE\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nand insert your own API key.\r\n\r\nIn addition to measuring all network traffic, this demo also includes a custom timer for measuring the render time of individual comics, and a custom metric tracking how often people share links.\r\n",
